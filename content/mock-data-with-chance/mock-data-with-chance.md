"You don't have enough baggage."

This is what they told me when I went through the interview. With just three years of software development experience I was too much of a rookie for the job I applied for.

First came the feeling of defeat. Then came frustration. And finally followed by the thought: _"Do years of experience matter?"_.

In recent years the churn of front-end technologies is so high often knowledge becomes obsolete within a couple of years, if not months. Of all the technologies that I've invested in three years ago, only a fraction I still use today. Of this fraction I'm expecting that also ít will become unused within the coming years.

Why is it then that companies outweigh years of experience over demonstratable skill? I can think of a couple of reasons.

### Flawed technical interview

First of all, it is very hard to test someones skill level in an interview. The number of posts on Hackernews on flawed technical interviews demonstrate the difficulty of assessing a candidates technical level. Instead of going for a flawed technical assessment and putting all the trust into the software developers capable of assessing, it is much easier for business to look at years of experience as a measurement.

### Growing flow of junior devs

Second, there are a growing number of developers from various sources such as bootcamps, crypto hackers flowing into the job market. The quickest and easiest filter junior developers to look at the amount of years a developer has been working.

### Experience does not result in better programmers

For the record, I dó believe there is an amount of skill that can only be acquired through professional work experience. For example, how to work within a team. How to deal with stakeholders. How to deal with manager expectations and how to navigate within a company culture. These are things that you cannot learn from books or by coding on your own. It needs to be put in practice working in a company.

However, I don't think the curve of acquiring these skills is linear.

Someone that worked for a short amount of time, but intensively for a project that demanded stakeholder management, will likely be better at it then someone without that experience. Or someone that with three years total experience but one year leading a team, is likely better at leading then someone with 10+ years of dev experience but none as team lead.

My point is this: it's not about the amount of years that defines a candidates skill. <br/>
**It is the specific skills acquired in those years that make the difference.**

### Another example

In my old job I have a colleague that has 10 years of work experience in the front-end. He has worked through the ages of Grunt, jQuery, Gulp, Angular.js and in recent years has picked up React. This person has 7 years more experience than me. However, if we were to deliver a feature now built on React I think I'd do a better job at deliver faster and better feature.

### How to measure?

The million dollar question is; how dó we measure the skill of an engineer? I think it starts with asking yourself the question, what are the skills we're looking for in an engineer? If it is technical skill, ask yourself how to test this and use it. There are a number of third party services that provide the tools to test a candidate from a technical perspective.

As for the soft skills, it's important to have a good, healthy conversation with the candidate.
