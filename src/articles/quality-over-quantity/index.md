"You don't have enough baggage."

This is what they told me when I first started the job. With just three years of software development experience I was too much of a rookie for the job. Then I wondered if it mattered, especially in the front-end space. 

In front-end development technologies change so rapidly that often knowledge acquired a few years ago, are irrelevant just a couple of years later. Technical knowledge in the framework is therefore unusable the day after.
